## üèãÔ∏è Attendance System Features Implemented:

1. **Manual Check-in/Check-out**: Admin can manually record attendance via dropdown selection
2. **QR Code Scanning**: Customers can check in by showing their QR code to the device camera
3. **Unique QR Codes**: Each customer receives a unique QR code in the format `GYM_CUSTOMER_ID:{id}`
4. **Automatic Check-in**: Scanned QR codes auto-submit attendance without manual selection
5. **Attendance Rules**: Enforced max check-ins per day, no duplicate active check-ins
6. **Attendance Records**: Logged customer ID, check-in time, branch, admin user, and method (QR/manual)
7. **Permission Integration**: Attendance feature shown only to admins with `attendance` permission
8. **Auto-checkout**: Customers auto-checked out after configurable time

## üìå Key Code Snippets:

### QR Code Generation:

```javascript
function generateCustomerQRCode(customerId) {
    const qrData = `GYM_CUSTOMER_ID:${customerId}`;
    const qrCodeUrl = `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=200x200&data=${encodeURIComponent(qrData)}`;
    return qrCodeUrl;
}
